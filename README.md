# Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-
This Project requires designing two different ANN architectures to classify the IRIS and Loangrant datasets. Data must be split 70/30, with confusion matrices and accuracy reported. Hidden layers and batch sizes must be varied, and a full IEEE-template report with original code must be submitted.
