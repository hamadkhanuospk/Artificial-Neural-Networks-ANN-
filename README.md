# Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-
Project Requirements :
1.  Consider the following 02 datasets IRIS and Loangrant. The data dictionary of Loangrant dataset Is attached. 
2.	Design Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  for the classification of both datasets. Keep in mind, you need to design 02 different ANN architectures for the classification of data. Use activation function of your       choice and it should be justified in the report. 
3.	Randomly split the data into 70%:30% ratio for model training and testing. Plot the confusion matrix of both training and testing and find the accuracy of the models.
4.	You need to increase/decrease the hidden layers of the network and report accuracy.
5.	The batch size needs to be adjusted according to the rule as discussed in class.
6.	Prepare a report of using IEEE conference template which is provided as an attachment. The references, figures, tables should be as per template. Use Endnote/Mendeley reference management software.
7.	The text/code should be written by your own and I will check plagiarism using Turnitin software and it should be less than 18%. AI generated content/text will not be accepted.
8.	Submit the assignment on or before the deadline.
9.	Submit the source file as well.  description of 340 characters
